Zones
=====

Calculates training zones using heartrate or powermeter

Terminology
-----------

``FTP``
: Functional threshold power. Designates heart rate or power required to cycle
for 1 hour as hard as you can.

``Training Zone``
: Seven sones established for training

Finding FTP
-----------

### Method1 ###

FTP heart rate = 220 - age

#### Zones

Zone 1. Active recovery

Day after a hard ride

68% of max heart rate, or 55% of power

Zone 2. Endurance

Trained cyclist should endure it 3 hours or more on consecutive days. Endurance
training zone

69-83% max heart rate, 56-75% of power

Zone 3. Tempo

0.5-3 hours on this intensity, couple days back to back is possible. Talking is
hard.

83-94% of heart rate, 76-90% of power

Zone 4. Lactate Threshold

2 lots by 20 minutes separated by 5 min of easy riding, conversation is
difficult, not for consequent days.

95-105% heart rate, 91-105% power

Zone 5. V02
Aerobic threshold, 3-8 minutes of duration

Burning in legs, high breathing

>106% heart, 106-120% power

Zone 6. Anaerobic

30sec-3min intervals

NA heart, 121% + power

Zone 7. Neuromascular zone

Going as hard as you can for 10 seconds
